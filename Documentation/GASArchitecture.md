## Overview

Makhia uses Unreal Engine's **Gameplay Ability System (GAS)** to manage character attributes (Health, Shield, Stamina), combat logic, equipment effects, and ability activation. The GAS integration is built on several custom classes that extend the default engine types:

| Custom Class | Engine Base | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `UMKHAbilitySystemComponent` | `UAbilitySystemComponent` | Ability granting, tag-based input routing, input queue, equipment integration |
| `UMKHAttributeSet` | `UAttributeSet` | Character attributes, damage/stamina-damage resolution, death event |
| `UMKHGameplayAbility` | `UGameplayAbility` | Base ability: input tags, montage orchestration, priority tags, queue hooks |
| `UMKHDamageAbility` | `UMKHGameplayAbility` | Damage-dealing abilities: attack data, combos, skill cooldowns |
| `UMKHMeleeAbility` | `UMKHDamageAbility` | Melee attacks: weapon hit scans + DMT soft-homing |
| `UMKHProjectileAbility` | `UMKHDamageAbility` | Projectile-spawning abilities |
| `UMKHAbilityGrantPayload` | `UObject` | Per-grant configuration attached to `FGameplayAbilitySpec::SourceObject` |
| `UMKHAbilityTask_ApplyDMT` | `UAbilityTask` | Ticking task rotating/moving the character towards the best melee target |
| `UExecCalc_Damage` | `UGameplayEffectExecutionCalculation` | Damage computation: block check, dodge check, crit roll |
| `UExecCalc_DodgeCost` | `UGameplayEffectExecutionCalculation` | Stamina cost for dodging |
| `FMKHGameplayEffectContext` | `FGameplayEffectContext` | Extended context: critical hit, dodge flag, on-hit status effects |
| `UMKHAbilitySystemGlobals` | `UAbilitySystemGlobals` | Allocates the custom effect context |

Logging for this layer uses the dedicated `LogMKHAbility` category (`MKHLogChannels.h`).

## Initialization Flow

GAS components are initialised at different points depending on whether the character is a player or an AI enemy.

### Player Characters

For player characters the ASC and attribute set live on the **Player State** (`AMKHPlayerState`), not on the character itself. This follows the recommended GAS pattern for multiplayer games where the Player State persists across respawns. `AMKHPlayerState` raises its net update frequency (100 Hz, min 66 Hz) to keep the ASC responsive in the 1v1 setting.

```
AMKHPlayerState (constructor)
  ├─ Creates UMKHAbilitySystemComponent (Replicated, Mixed mode)
  └─ Creates UMKHAttributeSet

AMKHPlayerCharacter::PossessedBy()          [Server]
  └─ InitAbilityActorInfo()
       ├─ Gets ASC and AttributeSet from PlayerState
       ├─ Calls ASC->InitAbilityActorInfo(PlayerState, this)
       ├─ BindCallbacksToDependencies()   (Health, Shield, Stamina delegates)
       ├─ MovementStateMachine->SyncCurrentStateTagToASC()
       └─ InitClassDefaults()             [Authority only]
            ├─ Loads CharacterClassInfo by CharacterTag
            ├─ ASC->AddCharacterAbilities(StartingAbilities)
            ├─ ASC->AddCharacterPassiveAbilities(StartingPassives)
            └─ ASC->InitializeDefaultAttributes(DefaultAttributes)

AMKHPlayerCharacter::OnRep_PlayerState()    [Client]
  └─ InitAbilityActorInfo()              (same flow, minus InitClassDefaults)
```

### Enemy Characters

Enemies own their ASC and attribute set directly:

```
AEnemyBase (constructor)
  ├─ Creates UMKHAbilitySystemComponent (Replicated, Minimal mode)
  └─ Creates UMKHAttributeSet

AEnemyBase::BeginPlay()
  ├─ BindCallbacksToDependencies()
  └─ InitAbilityActorInfo()
       ├─ ASC->InitAbilityActorInfo(this, this)
       └─ InitClassDefaults()            [Authority only]
```

**Replication modes**:
- **Player**: `Mixed` — the owner client predicts abilities locally while the server replicates Gameplay Effects to all clients.
- **Enemy**: `Minimal` — the server handles all ability logic; only effect results are replicated.

---

## Ability System Component

**Class**: `UMKHAbilitySystemComponent` (inherits `UAbilitySystemComponent`)
**Location**: `Source/Makhia/Public/AbilitySystem/MKHAbilitySystemComponent.h`

### Public API

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `AddCharacterAbilities(Abilities)` | Grants active abilities. Each ability's `InputTag` (from the CDO) is added to the spec's dynamic source tags so it can be activated by input. |
| `AddCharacterPassiveAbilities(Passives)` | Grants and immediately activates passive abilities via `GiveAbilityAndActivateOnce`. |
| `InitializeDefaultAttributes(AttributeEffect)` | Applies a `UGameplayEffect` that sets the initial attribute values, then broadcasts `OnAttributesGiven`. |
| `AbilityInputPressed(InputTag, bForceQueue)` | Routes a pressed input tag: queues it (`ShouldQueueAbility` / `bForceQueue`), sends the quick-slot event, or activates/forwards to the matching spec. |
| `AbilityInputReleased(InputTag)` | Sends `InputReleased` replicated event to matching active abilities. |
| `NotifyWeaponSwapRequested/Completed`, `IsWeaponSwapInFlight` | Client-side weapon-swap synchronization (see [Input Binding & Ability Queue](#input-binding--ability-queue)). |
| `HasGrantedAbilityForInputTag(InputTag)` | True when an activatable spec is already granted for the input tag (used to decide queue vs activate during equip round trips). |
| `GetCooldownRemainingForTag(CooldownTag, ...)` | Returns remaining/total cooldown duration for the effect granting the tag. |
| `AddEquipmentEffects(Entry)` / `RemoveEquipmentEffects(Entry)` | Applies/removes stat effects from an equipment entry (supports async loading via `FStreamableManager`). |
| `AddEquipmentAbility(Entry)` / `RemoveEquipmentAbility(Entry)` | Grants/clears abilities from an equipment entry (supports async loading). |

### OnGiveAbility (client-side retry)

`OnGiveAbility` also fires on clients when specs replicate down (e.g. after a weapon-equip RPC round trip). When a queued input matches the granted spec (or a weapon swap is in flight), the component schedules a **next-tick** flush of the input queue (`FlushQueuedAbilityAfterGrant`). The deferral is mandatory: the callback runs mid FastArray delta serialize, where server-removed specs are still physically inside `ActivatableAbilities` — activating synchronously would pick a stale spec.

### Delegate

```cpp
DECLARE_MULTICAST_DELEGATE(FOnAttributesGiven)
```

Broadcast after `InitializeDefaultAttributes` completes. Used by `AEnemyBase` to set a replicated flag so clients know attributes are ready.

---

## Input Binding & Ability Queue

Abilities are activated through a tag-based input system using Enhanced Input.

### Configuration & Binding

`UMKHInputConfig` (data asset) maps `UInputAction` assets to `FGameplayTag` values. `UMKHSystemInputComponent::BindAbilityActions` filters the config by a parent tag (`Input.Ability`) and binds `Started` → `AMKHPlayerController::AbilityInputPressed(Tag)` and `Completed` → `AbilityInputReleased(Tag)`.

### Activation Path

```
AMKHPlayerController::AbilityInputPressed(InputTag)
  ├─ For non-dodge attacks: EnsureWeaponEquipped()
  │    ├─ If a weapon swap is in flight → force-queue the input
  │    ├─ Armed check: equipment entry OR ASC already grants the input tag
  │    └─ If unarmed: quick-equip flow (queue or TryEquipWeapon + queue)
  └─ UMKHAbilitySystemComponent::AbilityInputPressed(InputTag, bForceQueue)
       ├─ ShouldQueueAbility?  → QueueAbility (input buffer)
       ├─ Quick-slot input     → Event::UseQuickSlot gameplay event
       └─ Otherwise            → TryActivateAbility / replicated InputPressed
```

### Input Queue

The buffering/priority logic (input buffer window, swap-into-attack chains, consumable priority) is documented in **`Documentation/QueueAbilitySystem.md`**, including the client-side **weapon swap in flight** state that keeps buffered attacks queued until the authoritative swap result replicates down.

### Priority Tags

Each ability may set a `PriorityTag` (`GameplayAbility.Active.Priority.First/Second`). While active, the tag blocks activation of same-or-lower priority abilities (`DoesAbilitySatisfyTagRequirements`). The `Event::MakeAbilityCancellable` gameplay event (raised by animation notifies) removes the tag early and flushes the input queue, enabling recovery-frame cancels.

---

## Ability Grant Payload

**Class**: `UMKHAbilityGrantPayload`
**Location**: `Source/Makhia/Public/AbilitySystem/MKHAbilityGrantPayload.h`

Equipment can grant the same ability class with different data (dynamic skill input tags, per-weapon attack data, rolled cooldowns). Writing that data on the ability CDO would turn the CDO into shared mutable state and cross-contaminate every owner using the same class. Instead:

1. `UMKHAbilitySystemComponent::GrantEquipmentAbility` fills a payload (`InputTag`, `ProjectileToSpawnTag`, `AttacksData`, `bIsSkillAbility`, cooldown data) and assigns it to `Spec.SourceObject`.
2. The input tag is also added to `Spec.GetDynamicSpecSourceTags()`, which is what input matching actually reads (the ability's own `InputTag` member is a CDO-level design value, not consumed per-instance).
3. `UMKHDamageAbility` / `UMKHProjectileAbility` read the payload in `OnGiveAbility` via the shared `GetGrantPayload(Spec)` helper and override their instance fields. This runs synchronously inside `GiveAbility` on the authority, so the payload does not need to outlive the grant call.
4. No explicit CDO fallback is needed: these abilities are `InstancedPerActor`, so each instance already starts from the CDO defaults. A null payload (remote clients, where `SourceObject` is not network-addressable; or non-equipment grants) simply leaves those defaults in place. All payload-driven data is consumed server-side, so empty client-side defaults are harmless.

Character base abilities (granted via `AddCharacterAbilities`) are plain `UMKHGameplayAbility` BPs with no per-grant data — they carry no payload and rely purely on their CDO `InputTag`.

**Rule: never mutate `Spec.Ability` — it is the class CDO.**

---

## Attribute Set

**Class**: `UMKHAttributeSet` (inherits `UAttributeSet`)
**Location**: `Source/Makhia/Public/AbilitySystem/Attributes/MKHAttributeSet.h`

### Attributes

| Attribute | Replicated | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Health` / `MaxHealth` | Yes | Current/maximum health, clamped to `[0, MaxHealth]` |
| `Shield` / `MaxShield` | Yes | Protective shield value, clamped to `[0, MaxShield]` |
| `Stamina` / `MaxStamina` | Yes | Resource for dodge/sprint/block, clamped to `[0, MaxStamina]` |
| `DodgeStaminaCost` | Yes | How much Stamina a dodge consumes |
| `CritChance` | Yes | Probability of a critical hit (0–100) |
| `CritDamageMod` | Yes | Bonus damage multiplier on critical hits |
| `IncomingDamage` | No (meta) | Written by `ExecCalc_Damage`, consumed in `PostGameplayEffectExecute` |
| `IncomingStaminaDamage` | No (meta) | Written by `ExecCalc_Damage` when the attack is blocked |

Each replicated attribute has an `OnRep_*` function that calls `GAMEPLAYATTRIBUTE_REPNOTIFY`.

### Key Overrides

- **`PreAttributeChange`**: clamp-only (Health, Stamina, Shield to their max values). No side effects here — the callback also runs on clients during replication.
- **`PostAttributeChange`**: when a max attribute changes, scales the current value proportionally via `AdjustAttributeForMaxChange` so the character keeps the same percentage.
- **`PostGameplayEffectExecute`**: resolves the meta attributes — `HandleIncomingDamage` (shield/health split, hit events, status effects, death) and `HandleIncomingStaminaDamage` (block/guard-break pipeline).

### Damage Resolution (`HandleIncomingDamage`)

1. If the context is flagged **dodged** (`FMKHGameplayEffectContext::IsDodged`): send `Event.Combat.AttackDodged` to both actors, apply nothing.
2. Otherwise split the damage between Shield and Health via `CalculateDamageSplit` — **Shield Break** (`ApplyShieldBreak`) if damage ≥ `Shield × 2.0`, normal mitigation (`ApplyShieldDamageMitigation`) otherwise. The scaling model is documented in **[ShieldDamageScaling.md](ShieldDamageScaling.md)**.
3. Send `Event.Combat.HitReceived` (defender) and `Event.Combat.HitInflicted` (attacker).
4. Apply the on-hit **status effects** carried by the context (`ApplyStatusEffectsFromContext`), with their duration passed via the `Combat.Data.StatusEffectDuration` set-by-caller.
5. **Death**: if Health reached 0, `TrySendDeathEvent` sends `Event.Combat.Death` to the avatar — authority-only, avatar-type agnostic (works for players and enemies), guarded by the `State.Movement.Dead` tag against double-firing.

### Stamina Damage Resolution (`HandleIncomingStaminaDamage`)

Runs when the attack was **blocked**:

1. Send `Event.Combat.BlockSuccessful` to both actors.
2. If stamina damage ≥ current Stamina → **Guard Break**: stamina zeroed, `Event.Combat.GuardBreak` sent to both actors.
3. Otherwise subtract the stamina damage.

### Shield Damage Scaling

The Shield is **armor, not a second health bar**: it scales the damage reaching Health and pays for
that protection out of its own pool, at a rate that guarantees it always breaks first.

The algorithm, its invariants, the tuning constants and the balance tables are documented in
**[ShieldDamageScaling.md](ShieldDamageScaling.md)**.

## Gameplay Abilities

### Ability Hierarchy

```
UGameplayAbility
  └─ UMKHGameplayAbility            (input tags, montage, priority, queue hooks)
       └─ UMKHDamageAbility         (attack data, combos, skill cooldowns, owning weapon)
            ├─ UMKHMeleeAbility     (hit scans + DMT)
            └─ UMKHProjectileAbility (projectile spawning)
```

### UMKHGameplayAbility

Base class for every ability. Key behaviors:

- **`InputTag`** (`EditDefaultsOnly`): added to the spec's dynamic source tags on grant; matched by `AbilityInputPressed`. Skills receive theirs dynamically via the grant payload.
- **`ActivateAbility`**: binds input press/release tasks, **commits the ability and aborts on a failed commit** (cost/cooldown), adds the loose `PriorityTag` (locally controlled), plays `MontageToPlay` when set.
- **`EndAbility`**: removes the priority tag and fires `Event::ActivateQueuedAbility` (before `Super`, guarded against double-firing) so buffered inputs resolve immediately; force-stops the montage on remote peers only when cancelled.
- **`OnMakeAbilityCancellable`**: animation-notify driven early-cancel point — removes the priority tag and flushes the input queue.
- **Blueprint hooks**: `OnAbilityActivatedAgain`, `OnAbilityReleased`, `OnAbilityRemoved`, `OnMontageStarted`, `OnMontageFinished`.

### UMKHDamageAbility

- **`AttacksData`** (`TArray<FAttackData>`): per-strike damage percent, stamina damage, and status effects. Indexed by the combo hit counter.
- **Combo system**: `Event.Animation.ContinueCombo.Start/End` notifies open/close the combo window; re-pressing the input inside the window triggers `OnComboTriggered(++ComboHitCounter)`, otherwise the ability ends.
- **Skill cooldowns**: skills (`bIsSkillAbility`) apply a generic cooldown effect whose duration travels as the `Combat.Data.AbilityCooldownTime` set-by-caller and whose granted tags come from the rolled `CooldownTags`.
- **`CaptureDamageEffectInfo`**: fills `FDamageEffectInfo` (base damage from weapon damage × attack percent, stamina damage, status effects, source/target ASC) consumed by `UMKHAbilitySystemLibrary::ApplyDamageEffect`.
- **`OwningWeapon`**: resolved on activation (authority) through the controller's `UEquipmentManagerComponent`.

### UMKHMeleeAbility

- **Hit scans**: `Event.Animation.HitScan.Start/End` notifies (bound authority-only) drive `AMKHWeaponBase::HitScanStart/End` with the captured damage info.
- **DMT (Directional Movement Technique)**: `UMKHAbilityTask_ApplyDMT` is a ticking task that picks the best target in a radius/angle (score = alignment + proximity) and interpolates the character's rotation/position towards it during the attack. Re-triggered on every combo strike and by the `Event.Animation.ApplyDMT` notify. Note: it moves the character with `SetActorLocation` outside the CharacterMovementComponent — acceptable for short bursts, but a known source of server corrections under heavy latency.

### UMKHProjectileAbility

- `ProjectileToSpawnTag` (per grant, via payload) resolves `FProjectileParams` from `UProjectileInfo`.
- `Event.Animation.SpawnProjectile` triggers `SpawnProjectile`, which deferred-spawns the `AMKHProjectileBase`, injects params + `FDamageEffectInfo`, and finishes spawning.

---

## Execution Calculations

Execution calculations are **pure computation**: they read captures/set-by-callers, compute output modifiers, and annotate the effect context. All side effects (gameplay events, status effect application) live in `UMKHAttributeSet::PostGameplayEffectExecute`.

### ExecCalc_Damage

1. Early-out if the target is dead.
2. **Block check** (`IsAttackBlocked`): target has `State.Movement.Blocking` and faces the attacker (2D dot product > 0) → the attack is blocked:
   - Reads `Combat.Data.StaminaDamage` set-by-caller, reduces it by the defender weapon's block stability (`RefineStaminaDamage`), outputs to `IncomingStaminaDamage`.
3. Otherwise (**health damage path**):
   - Reads `Combat.Data.Damage` set-by-caller.
   - **Dodge check**: target has `State.Movement.Dodging` → sets `bDodged` on the context and outputs the would-be damage (the attribute set skips application and only notifies).
   - **Crit roll**: `RandRange(1,100) <= CritChance` → `Damage × (1 + CritDamageMod)`; result flagged on the context (`bCriticalHit`).
   - Outputs to `IncomingDamage`.

### ExecCalc_DodgeCost

Captures `Stamina`, `MaxStamina`, `DodgeStaminaCost`; consumes `min(DodgeStaminaCost, Stamina)` so a low-stamina dodge drains whatever is left.

---

## Custom Effect Context

**Struct**: `FMKHGameplayEffectContext` (inherits `FGameplayEffectContext`)
**Location**: `Source/Makhia/Public/AbilitySystem/MKHAbilityTypes.h`

Extends the default effect context with:

- `bCriticalHit` — set by `ExecCalc_Damage`, replicated (bit 7 of `RepBits`), readable by UI.
- `StatusEffects` (`TArray<FStatusEffectData>`) — on-hit effects set by `ApplyDamageEffect`, replicated (bit 8), applied by the attribute set after damage.
- `bDodged` — server-only flag (intentionally **not** serialized): written by the ExecCalc and consumed by the attribute set in the same frame.

`UMKHAbilitySystemGlobals::AllocGameplayEffectContext` returns this type for every effect in the game (configured via `AbilitySystemGlobalsClassName`).

---

## Damage Pipeline

```
1. Ability activates (UMKHMeleeAbility hit scan / UMKHProjectileAbility hit)
       │
2. CaptureDamageEffectInfo() fills FDamageEffectInfo
       │
3. UMKHAbilitySystemLibrary::ApplyDamageEffect()
       ├─ Creates effect context with source actor
       ├─ Stores AdditionalStatusEffects in the FMKHGameplayEffectContext
       ├─ Creates outgoing spec from DamageEffect class
       ├─ SetByCaller: Combat.Data.Damage + Combat.Data.StaminaDamage
       └─ Applies spec to target ASC
              │
4. ExecCalc_Damage (pure computation)
       ├─ Target dead?      → no output
       ├─ Blocked (facing)? → IncomingStaminaDamage (reduced by block stability)
       ├─ Dodged?           → context.bDodged, IncomingDamage (skipped later)
       └─ Else crit roll    → context.bCriticalHit, IncomingDamage
              │
5. UMKHAttributeSet::PostGameplayEffectExecute (server-side effects)
       ├─ HandleIncomingStaminaDamage: BlockSuccessful → stamina loss / GuardBreak
       └─ HandleIncomingDamage:
            ├─ bDodged → AttackDodged events, no damage
            ├─ Shield break / mitigation → Shield & Health reduction
            ├─ HitReceived / HitInflicted events
            ├─ Status effects from context (Data.StatusEffectDuration set-by-caller)
            └─ Health ≤ 0 → Event.Combat.Death (authority, once, any avatar type)
```

---

## Equipment Integration

Equipment items can grant both passive stat effects and active abilities through the GAS.

### Equipping Flow

```
UInventoryComponent::UseItem (server)
  └─ EquipmentItemUsedDelegate → UEquipmentManagerComponent::EquipItem
       └─ FRPGEquipmentList::AddEntry
            ├─ Creates UEquipmentInstance
            ├─ ASC->AddEquipmentEffects()   (GE stat modifiers, async-load aware)
            ├─ ASC->AddEquipmentAbility()   (abilities via GrantEquipmentAbility + payload)
            └─ Instance->SpawnEquipmentActors()
```

Rarity, passive stats, and active abilities are rolled at **inventory add time** (`FRPGInventoryList::RollEquipmentEntry` via `UEquipmentRollLibrary`), where skills also receive their dynamic input tags (`UMKHAbilitySystemLibrary::AssignDynamicSkillInputTag` → `Input.Ability.Attacks.Skill.First/Second/Third`).

### Effect Handles

`FEquipmentGrantedHandles` tracks granted ability spec handles and active effect handles per entry, enabling clean removal on unequip.

### Async Loading

Both `AddEquipmentEffects` and `AddEquipmentAbility` support soft class pointers with asynchronous loading via `FStreamableManager::RequestAsyncLoad`; quick-slotted weapons are preloaded (`UInventoryComponent::PreloadItem`) so swaps don't hitch.

## Data Assets

### UCharacterClassInfo

Maps `FGameplayTag` character class identifiers to default attributes and starting (passive) abilities. Stored on `AMKHGameMode`, accessed via `UMKHAbilitySystemLibrary::GetCharacterClassDefaultInfo`.

### UProjectileInfo

Maps `FGameplayTag` → `FProjectileParams` (projectile class, mesh, speed, gravity, bounce). Stored on `AMKHGameMode`, accessed via `UMKHAbilitySystemLibrary::GetProjectileInfo`.

### UGenericClassReference

Maps well-known `FName` keys to Blueprint classes that native code must reference without hard dependencies. The canonical keys are named constants on the class — never spell them inline:

| Constant | Key | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `UGenericClassReference::DamageEffectKey` | `GE_Damage` | `UMKHDamageAbility::AssignBPClasses` |
| `UGenericClassReference::SkillCooldownEffectKey` | `GE_GenericSkillCooldown` | `UMKHDamageAbility::AssignBPClasses` |

Use the typed accessor `GetGameplayEffectByName` for gameplay effect classes.
