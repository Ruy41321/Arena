/**
 * Base class for every gameplay ability in Makhia.
 *
 * Adds on top of UGameplayAbility:
 * - Tag-based input binding (InputTag, matched via the spec's dynamic source tags).
 * - Automatic montage orchestration (MontageToPlay + OnMontageStarted/Finished hooks).
 * - Priority tags (Priority1/Priority2) governing which abilities may interrupt others.
 * - Integration with the input queue: EndAbility and the MakeAbilityCancellable event
 *   fire Event::ActivateQueuedAbility so buffered inputs resolve at the earliest frame
 *   (see Documentation/QueueAbilitySystem.md).
