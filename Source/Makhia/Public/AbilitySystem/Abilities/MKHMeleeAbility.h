/**
 * Damage ability specialized for melee combat.
 *
 * Hit detection follows the client-predicted / server-validated pattern:
 * - The locally-controlled machine (owning client for players, server for AI) listens for the
 *   HitScanStart/End animation-notify events — the only machine where those notifies are
 *   reliable — and drives the weapon's native melee scan.
 * - Every detected hit is shipped to the server as replicated target data
 *   (FMKHGameplayAbilityTargetData_MeleeHit) inside a scoped prediction window.
 * - The server validates each hit for plausibility (range, cone, re-hit throttling, per-swing
 *   de-duplication) before applying damage, so authority is preserved without depending on
 *   the server's lag-shifted animation timeline.
 *
 * The server proxy of a remote player never self-terminates from its own montage/combo
 * timeline (which lags the client's); it ends through the client's replicated EndAbility,
 * bounded by a lifetime failsafe.
 *
 * Also drives the Directional Movement Technique (DMT) that softly homes the character
 * towards the best target while attacking, re-triggered on every combo strike.
