/**
 * Per-grant data attached to an ability spec via FGameplayAbilitySpec::SourceObject.
 *
 * Equipment can grant the same ability class to different weapons with different data
 * (dynamic skill input tags, attack data, rolled cooldowns). Writing that on the ability
 * CDO would make it shared mutable state across every owner of the class, so
 * GrantEquipmentAbility fills this payload instead and the instance reads it back in
 * OnGiveAbility, which runs synchronously on the authority.
 *
 * Not replicated: SourceObject doesn't resolve on remote clients, but that's fine since
 * this data (damage, cooldowns, projectile spawning) is only used server-side anyway.
